A vanilla friendly mod created from the ideas sent to the Balatro Discord
Suggestion Containment Area.

Note there are some fairly invasive lovely patches included in this mod, it may
not play nicely with other mods.  This mod is intended mostly to test, proof of
concept, and evaluate the various ideas suggested on the suggestion forums.  Not
to be a complete and cohesive gameplay experience.

(The presence of lovely patches doesn't make this mod "not vanilla" as "vanilla"
here is being used to emphasize that the desire is for balanced gameplay with
interesting effects "like" unmodded Balatro, which is not the same as "only
using ideas from" unmodded Balatro, this unavoidably necessitates patches...)
